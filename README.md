# Data-Mining
In this project, I will act as a consultant for ABCDE Eats Inc. (ABCDE), a fictional food delivery service partnering with a range of restaurants to offer diverse meal options. My task is to analyze customer data collected over three months from three cities to help ABCDE develop a data-driven strategy tailored to various customer segments. The description of the data is provided under the Dataset Description section of this document.

I will segment customers using multiple perspectives. Examples of segmentation perspectives include value-based segmentation, which groups customers by their economic value; preference or behavior-based segmentation, which focuses on purchasing habits; and demographic segmentation, which categorizes customers by attributes like age, gender, and income to understand different interaction patterns.

Ultimately, the goal is to develop a final segmentation that integrates these perspectives, enabling ABCDE to craft a comprehensive marketing strategy.
